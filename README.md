I like to build complex things in a simple way, and to make existing things better, faster, stronger and cheaper. I am attracted to technically challenging topics and cross-disciplinary teams. I'm a [Grug Brained Developer](https://grugbrain.dev/).

To download my book about Functional Programming (6k+ readers), go to [leanpub/fpmortals](https://leanpub.com/fpmortals).

This collection of repositories (see also my [gitlab/fommil](https://gitlab.com/fommil/) and [gitlab/tseenshe](https://gitlab.com/tseenshe) accounts and [abandoned projects](https://gitlab.com/fommil/attic)) is an example of my contributions to open source. I contribute to the simracing assistant [CrewChief](https://gitlab.com/mr_belowski/CrewChiefV4/).

I'm currently hacking on projects in digital electronics ([8-bit computer from transistors](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU)), 3d printing, and astronomy (image / video capture and auto guiding), exercising my C++ muscles. I'll make them public when they hit an MVP.
