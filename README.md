I like to build complex and highly scalable things in a simple way, and make existing things run faster, bigger, and cheaper. I am attracted to technically challenging topics and cross-disciplinary teams. I align with the [Grug Brained Developer](https://grugbrain.dev/) philosophy.

To see my work experience, go to [linkedin/samhalliday](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samhalliday/).

To download my book about Functional Programming in Scala (6k+ readers), go to [leanpub/fpmortals](https://leanpub.com/fpmortals).

This collection of repositories (see also my [gitlab/fommil](https://gitlab.com/fommil/) and [gitlab/tseenshe](https://gitlab.com/tseenshe) accounts and [abandoned projects](https://gitlab.com/fommil/attic)) is a small collection of my open source works. Github unfortunately deleted all the stars on the [ENSIME](https://ensime.github.io/) repos, but it was once popular I swear! I also contribute to the iRacing parts of the simracing assistant [CrewChief](https://gitlab.com/mr_belowski/CrewChiefV4/), hope to see you on the track.

I'm currently hacking on projects in digital electronics (tangents when building an [8-bit computer from scratch](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU)), 3d printing, and astronomy (super simple data capture and auto guiding), exercising my C++ muscles. I'll make them public when they hit an MVP.
